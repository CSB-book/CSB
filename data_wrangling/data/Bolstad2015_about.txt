Content of datafile:
Species: species identifier hopefully self explanatory, normally [first letter in genus]_[species or subspecies, abbreviated], see table S6 in Bolstad et al. 2015 for the scientific name; 
ID: individual fly ID in the form of the picture name;
Date: the date the image of the fly was taken (day_month_year); 
Sex: the sex of each fly, where F codes for female and M codes for male; 
WingSize: the size of each fly's wing in log(mm) (square root of area on the natural logarithmic scale); 
L2Length: length of vein L2 in log(mm), where log is the natural logarithm
