# Installing the `UNIX` Terminal

## Linux

No installation is required. 

## OS X

No installation is required. However, you might want to improve the appearance by changing some settings, as described [here](http://howtogeek.com/210308/how-to-change-the-os-x-terminals-appearance-with-profiles/).


## Windows

You can use the `Git Bash` terminal, which is installed with `Git` (which you will need for the next Chapter anyway). You can find instructions for the installation [here](https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB/blob/master/git/installation/install.md).
